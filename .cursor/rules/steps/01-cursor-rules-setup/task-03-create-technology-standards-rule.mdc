# Task 1.3: Create Technology Standards Rule

## Context
This task creates the comprehensive `technology-standards.mdc` rule that defines coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices for the entire AI Feature Tracker technology stack. The rule must establish consistent patterns across Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, Anthropic API, and Tailwind CSS while being accessible to a developer with C#/.NET background.

## AI Instructions

### 1. Create Technology Standards Rule File Structure
- Open `.cursor/rules/standards/technology-standards.mdc` file
- Create proper MDC frontmatter with description and type: "Always"
- Set up the rule to be automatically applied to all AI interactions
- Include proper metadata for comprehensive technology guidance

### 2. Define Next.js 14 App Router Standards
Create comprehensive Next.js 14 guidelines including:
- **App Router Exclusive Usage**: Use App Router exclusively with proper server/client component separation
- **File-Based Routing**: Establish standards for `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx`
- **Server vs Client Components**: Clear guidelines on when to use each type with performance implications
- **Metadata API**: Proper implementation for SEO optimization and social sharing
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component with responsive design and performance optimization
- **Route Organization**: Proper route groups, layouts, and nested routing structures

### 3. Establish TypeScript Strict Mode Standards
Define comprehensive TypeScript requirements:
- **Strict Mode Configuration**: Enable all strict compiler options with zero compromises
- **Type Definitions**: Proper interfaces, types, and discriminated unions for all functions and components
- **Utility Types**: Effective use of Pick, Omit, Partial, Record, and custom utility types
- **Type Safety**: 100% type coverage with no `any` types or disabled TypeScript checks
- **Error Handling**: Typed error boundaries and comprehensive error type definitions
- **Generic Types**: Proper use of generics for reusable components and utilities

### 4. Define React Component Standards
Establish React best practices aligned with modern patterns:
- **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- **Component Composition**: Favor composition over inheritance with proper prop patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic use of React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper error boundaries with fallback UI
- **Key Props**: Proper key usage for list rendering and component reconciliation
- **Hook Dependencies**: Proper cleanup in useEffect with comprehensive dependency arrays
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extraction with proper naming and return patterns

### 5. Create Supabase Integration Standards
Define comprehensive Supabase patterns:
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Mandatory RLS for all tables with proper policy implementation  
- **Type Generation**: Automatic TypeScript type generation from database schema
- **Client Management**: Proper Supabase client instantiation, connection management, and cleanup
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Efficient real-time usage with proper subscription lifecycle management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all database operations with typed responses
- **Caching Strategies**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed data with invalidation patterns
- **Query Optimization**: Proper indexing, joins, and query performance considerations

### 6. Establish Anthropic API Integration Standards
Create AI integration best practices:
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper rate limiting implementation respecting API quotas and usage tiers
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff, retry logic, and graceful degradation patterns
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompt templates with clear instructions and context management
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript definitions for API requests, responses, and error states
- **Cost Optimization**: Token usage monitoring, efficient prompting, and model selection strategies
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive API usage tracking, performance metrics, and error reporting
- **Security**: Proper API key management, environment variable handling, and request validation

### 7. Define Tailwind CSS Standards
Establish styling and design system standards:
- **Utility-First Approach**: Use Tailwind utilities exclusively with minimal custom CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoint usage
- **Design System**: Consistent spacing, sizing, and color palette usage across components
- **Component Patterns**: Reusable component styling patterns with Tailwind utilities
- **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast, focus indicators, and accessible design patterns
- **Performance**: Efficient class usage and purging for optimal bundle size

### 8. Create Code Organization and Architecture Standards
Define project structure and architectural patterns:
- **Domain-Driven Structure**: Organize code by business domains, not technical layers
- **Single Responsibility**: Functions and modules with clear, focused purposes
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling through proper dependency management
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings with type safety and validation
- **Barrel Exports**: Clean import patterns with proper index.ts files
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error boundaries and centralized error management

### 9. Establish Performance and Optimization Standards
Create performance-first development patterns:
- **Code Splitting**: Strategic dynamic imports and component-level lazy loading
- **Bundle Optimization**: Efficient bundling with tree shaking and dead code elimination
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-layer caching (browser, CDN, API response, database query)
- **Core Web Vitals**: Maintain excellent performance metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images, lazy loading, and modern format usage
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization, connection pooling, and index usage

### 10. Define Security and Quality Standards
Establish security-first development practices:
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation at all entry points
- **Authentication**: Proper JWT handling, session management, and authorization patterns
- **Environment Security**: Secure secret management and environment variable handling
- **API Security**: Proper CORS, rate limiting, and request validation
- **Content Security**: XSS prevention, SQL injection protection, and secure data handling
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting, formatting, and quality gate enforcement

## Expected Output
Complete `technology-standards.mdc` rule file containing:
- Comprehensive technology standards for entire tech stack
- Clear coding patterns and architectural guidelines
- Performance and security best practices
- C#/.NET background-friendly explanations and analogies
- Project-specific standards for AI Feature Tracker requirements
