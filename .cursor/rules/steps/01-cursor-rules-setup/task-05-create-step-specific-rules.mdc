# Task 1.5: Create Step-Specific Rules (Steps 2-15)

## Context
This task creates 70+ individual task rule files across 14 numbered step folders (02-15). Each rule file must have focused context limited to its specific task domain, reference the global standards, include dependencies from previous tasks, and provide clear completion criteria. This granular approach ensures maximum AI control and prevents scope creep.

## AI Instructions

### 1. Create Completely Empty Task Rule Files for Step 2: Infrastructure (02-infrastructure/)
Create the following completely empty task rule files in `.cursor/rules/steps/02-infrastructure/`:

#### task-01-initialize-nextjs-project.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-02-configure-development-environment.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-03-create-project-folder-structure.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-04-setup-environment-configuration.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-05-configure-typescript-build-system.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

### 2. Create Completely Empty Task Rule Files for Step 3: Supabase Project Setup (03-supabase-project-setup/)
Create the following completely empty task rule files in `.cursor/rules/steps/03-supabase-project-setup/`:

#### task-01-create-supabase-project.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-02-design-implement-database-schema.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-03-configure-row-level-security.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-04-setup-database-types-client-integration.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

#### task-05-seed-database-initial-data.mdc
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content]
```

### 3. Create Completely Empty Files for Remaining Steps (04-15)
For each remaining step (04-app-structure through 15-production-deployment), create completely empty task rule files with no content:

#### File Naming Convention
- Use format: `task-01-[descriptive-name].mdc`, `task-02-[descriptive-name].mdc`, etc.
- Each step starts numbering from 01, 02, 03, 04, 05
- Place in appropriate numbered folder: `04-app-structure/`, `05-tool-data-display/`, etc.

#### Completely Empty File Structure
```markdown
[Completely empty file - no content whatsoever]
```
