# Task 3.1: Create Supabase Project

## Context
You are working on the AI Feature Tracker project, a single-page dashboard that tracks feature updates across 15 popular AI development tools. This task focuses specifically on creating and configuring the Supabase project that will serve as the backend database and real-time infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
- Next.js 14 project has been initialized with TypeScript (Task 2.1 completed)
- Development environment is configured (Task 2.2 completed)
- Project folder structure is created (Task 2.3 completed)
- Environment configuration system is in place (Task 2.4 completed)

## Reference Standards
Apply the following standards from global rules:
- @global-behavior: Follow systematic, step-by-step approach with clear explanations
- @technology-standards: Use Supabase best practices and proper TypeScript integration
- @quality-standards: Implement proper error handling, security, and documentation

## AI Instructions

### 1. Create New Supabase Project
- Navigate to https://supabase.com and create a new project
- Use project name: "ai-feature-tracker" 
- Select region: Choose the closest region to target users (US East for optimal performance)
- Choose a strong database password and document it securely
- Wait for project creation to complete (2-3 minutes)
- Document the project URL and database connection details

### 2. Configure Project Settings
- Access project settings in Supabase dashboard
- Navigate to Settings → General and verify project configuration
- Go to Settings → API to obtain project credentials:
  - Copy Project URL (starts with https://[project-ref].supabase.co)
  - Copy anon public key (for client-side access)
  - Copy service_role key (for server-side admin access)
- Document all keys securely for environment variable setup

### 3. Install and Configure Supabase CLI
- Install Supabase CLI globally: `npm install -g supabase`
- Verify installation: `supabase --version`
- Navigate to project root directory
- Initialize Supabase locally: `supabase init`
- Login to Supabase CLI: `supabase login`
- Link local project to remote: `supabase link --project-ref [your-project-ref]`
- Verify connection: `supabase status`

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
- Update `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your-service-role-key]
  ```
- Update `.env.local.example` template with placeholder values
- Verify environment variables are properly excluded from git in `.gitignore`

### 5. Initialize Database Extensions
- Access Supabase dashboard → Database → Extensions
- Enable the following extensions:
  - **uuid-ossp**: For UUID generation
  - **pgcrypto**: For cryptographic functions
- Verify extensions are enabled in the Extensions tab
- Test extension functionality by running simple queries in SQL Editor

### 6. Verify Database Connection
- Open Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
- Run test query to verify database connectivity:
  ```sql
  SELECT version();
  SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname IN ('uuid-ossp', 'pgcrypto');
  ```
- Verify results show PostgreSQL version and enabled extensions
- Test database connection from local environment (will be used in next task)

### 7. Configure Project Documentation
- Create `docs/supabase-setup.md` file documenting:
  - Project configuration details (region, settings)
  - Environment variable structure
  - CLI setup steps
  - Extension configuration
  - Connection verification steps
- Add troubleshooting section for common setup issues

## Expected Deliverables
- Functional Supabase project with proper configuration
- Supabase CLI installed and linked to project
- Environment variables properly configured
- Database extensions enabled and verified
- Connection verified through dashboard and CLI
- Documentation created for project setup

## Quality Requirements
- All credentials must be stored securely in environment variables
- No sensitive information committed to git repository
- Database connection must be verified and functional
- CLI must be properly linked and authenticated
- Documentation must be comprehensive and accurate
