# Task 3.3: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

## Context
You are working on the AI Feature Tracker project, a public information platform that tracks feature updates across 15 popular AI development tools. This task focuses on implementing Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure proper access control where anonymous users can read all public data, while administrative operations (data updates, AI processing) are restricted to service role access only.

## Prerequisites
- Supabase project created and configured (Task 3.1 completed)
- Complete database schema implemented (Task 3.2 completed)
- All tables created: `tool_categories`, `ai_tools`, `feature_updates`, `update_history`
- Foreign key relationships and constraints established
- Database connection verified and functional

## Reference Standards
Apply the following standards from global rules:
- @global-behavior: Follow systematic, step-by-step approach with clear security explanations
- @technology-standards: Use Supabase RLS best practices and PostgreSQL security patterns
- @quality-standards: Implement comprehensive security testing and validation

## AI Instructions

### 1. Enable Row Level Security on All Tables
Enable RLS on each table in the correct order (avoiding foreign key conflicts):
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE tool_categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ai_tools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE feature_updates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE update_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('tool_categories', 'ai_tools', 'feature_updates', 'update_history');
```
- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
- Verify all tables show `rowsecurity = true`
- Confirm RLS status in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Policies

### 2. Create Public Read Access Policies
Create policies allowing anonymous users to read all public data:
```sql
-- Tool Categories - Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for tool categories" ON tool_categories
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (true);  -- Allow all users to read categories

-- AI Tools - Public read access for active tools only
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for active tools" ON ai_tools
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (is_active = true);  -- Only show active tools to public

-- Feature Updates - Public read access for validated updates only
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for validated updates" ON feature_updates
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (validation_status = 'validated');  -- Only show validated updates to public

-- Update History - No public access (admin/audit only)
-- No public read policy for update_history table
```
- Execute each policy creation
- Verify policies created in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Policies
- Test public access by querying tables without authentication

### 3. Create Service Role Administrative Policies
Create comprehensive policies for service role (full admin access):
```sql
-- Tool Categories - Service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to tool categories" ON tool_categories
    FOR ALL 
    USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- AI Tools - Service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to ai tools" ON ai_tools
    FOR ALL 
    USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- Feature Updates - Service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to feature updates" ON feature_updates
    FOR ALL 
    USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- Update History - Service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to update history" ON update_history
    FOR ALL 
    USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');
```
- Execute all service role policies
- Verify policies show in dashboard with correct conditions
- Test service role access using service_role key

### 4. Create AI Processing Policies
Create specific policies for AI automation processes:
```sql
-- Feature Updates - Allow AI to update analysis fields
CREATE POLICY "AI processing updates for feature validation" ON feature_updates
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role')
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role' AND
        -- Only allow updates to AI-related fields
        (OLD.title = NEW.title AND OLD.content = NEW.content AND OLD.tool_id = NEW.tool_id)
    );

-- Update History - Allow AI to create audit trail entries
CREATE POLICY "AI processing audit trail creation" ON update_history
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role' AND
        changed_by LIKE 'ai_%'  -- AI processes must identify themselves
    );
```
- Execute AI-specific policies
- Verify policies allow only specified field updates
- Test with sample AI processing operations

### 5. Create Security Helper Functions
Create utility functions for common security checks:
```sql
-- Function to check if current user can modify data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.can_modify_data()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Function to check if current user can read sensitive data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.can_read_sensitive_data()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Function to get current user role safely
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.get_user_role()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN COALESCE(auth.jwt() ->> 'role', 'anon');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```
- Execute helper function creation
- Test functions return expected values
- Verify functions work with different authentication contexts

### 6. Implement Data Visibility Controls
Add additional policies for fine-grained data visibility:
```sql
-- AI Tools - Hide tools in development/testing
CREATE POLICY "Hide development tools from public" ON ai_tools
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        is_active = true AND 
        (metadata->>'development_mode' IS NULL OR metadata->>'development_mode' = 'false')
    );

-- Feature Updates - Control visibility based on confidence score
CREATE POLICY "High confidence updates only for public" ON feature_updates
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (
        validation_status = 'validated' AND
        (confidence_score IS NULL OR confidence_score >= 0.7)  -- Only show high-confidence AI validations
    );
```
- Execute visibility control policies
- Test policies hide appropriate records from public access
- Verify service role can still access all data

### 7. Configure Real-time Security
Set up security for real-time subscriptions:
```sql
-- Enable real-time for public tables with security
-- This is configured in Supabase Dashboard → Database → Replication
-- But we need to ensure RLS applies to real-time subscriptions

-- Create publication for real-time (if not exists)
-- Note: Supabase creates this automatically, but we verify it exists
SELECT * FROM pg_publication WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';

-- Verify RLS applies to real-time subscriptions
-- Check that realtime respects our RLS policies
```
- Verify real-time replication respects RLS policies
- Test real-time subscriptions honor security boundaries
- Confirm public subscriptions only receive allowed data

### 8. Test RLS Policies Comprehensively
Perform thorough testing of all security policies:
```sql
-- Test 1: Anonymous user can read public data
-- (Execute without authentication)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tool_categories;  -- Should work
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_tools WHERE is_active = true;  -- Should work
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM feature_updates WHERE validation_status = 'validated';  -- Should work
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM update_history;  -- Should fail or return 0

-- Test 2: Anonymous user cannot modify data
-- INSERT INTO tool_categories (name) VALUES ('Test Category');  -- Should fail
-- UPDATE ai_tools SET name = 'Modified' WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM ai_tools LIMIT 1);  -- Should fail

-- Test 3: Service role can access all data
-- (Execute with service_role authentication)
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM update_history;  -- Should work with service_role key
-- INSERT INTO tool_categories (name) VALUES ('Test Category');  -- Should work with service_role key
```
- Execute all test scenarios
- Verify expected access/denial patterns
- Document any unexpected behavior for troubleshooting

### 9. Create Security Documentation
Document the complete security model:
```sql
-- Create a view documenting all RLS policies
CREATE VIEW security_policy_summary AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Query to show current security status
SELECT 
    t.tablename,
    t.rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    COUNT(p.policyname) as policy_count
FROM pg_tables t
LEFT JOIN pg_policies p ON t.tablename = p.tablename
WHERE t.schemaname = 'public' 
AND t.tablename IN ('tool_categories', 'ai_tools', 'feature_updates', 'update_history')
GROUP BY t.tablename, t.rowsecurity
ORDER BY t.tablename;
```
- Create security documentation views
- Generate current security status report
- Document policy purposes and access patterns
