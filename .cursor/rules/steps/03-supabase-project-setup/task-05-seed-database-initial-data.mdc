    executed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    success BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    details TEXT
);

-- Insert migration record
INSERT INTO data_migrations (migration_name, details) VALUES
('initial_seed_data_v1', 'Initial seed data including 15 AI tools, categories, and sample updates');

-- Create view for easy data overview
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW data_overview AS
SELECT 
    tc.name as category_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) as tools_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fu.id) as updates_count,
    MAX(fu.published_date) as latest_update_date
FROM tool_categories tc
LEFT JOIN ai_tools t ON tc.id = t.category_id
LEFT JOIN feature_updates fu ON t.id = fu.tool_id AND fu.validation_status = 'validated'
GROUP BY tc.id, tc.name, tc.sort_order
ORDER BY tc.sort_order;
```
- Execute migration tracking setup
- Create data overview view
- Verify migration tracking works

### 7. Validate All Seed Data
Perform comprehensive validation of all inserted data:
```sql
-- Run comprehensive data validation
SELECT * FROM validate_data_consistency();

-- Get data statistics
SELECT * FROM get_data_statistics();

-- Get data overview
SELECT * FROM data_overview;

-- Test some key queries that the application will use
SELECT 
    t.name,
    t.slug,
    tc.name as category,
    COUNT(fu.id) as update_count
FROM ai_tools t
LEFT JOIN tool_categories tc ON t.category_id = tc.id
LEFT JOIN feature_updates fu ON t.id = fu.tool_id AND fu.validation_status = 'validated'
WHERE t.is_active = true
GROUP BY t.id, t.name, t.slug, tc.name
ORDER BY COUNT(fu.id) DESC;

-- Test tools with latest updates view
SELECT * FROM tools_with_latest_updates LIMIT 5;

-- Test recent updates view
SELECT * FROM recent_feature_updates LIMIT 10;
```
- Execute all validation queries
- Verify data consistency and relationships
- Confirm application views work correctly

### 8. Create Development Data Reset Workflow

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_sample_data()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Only allow in development environment
    IF current_setting('app.environment', true) = 'production' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot refresh sample data in production environment';
    END IF;
    
    -- Reset and reload data
    PERFORM reset_all_data();
    
    -- Re-run seed data insertion (would need to be called separately)
    RAISE NOTICE 'Sample data reset. Re-run seed data insertion scripts.';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
