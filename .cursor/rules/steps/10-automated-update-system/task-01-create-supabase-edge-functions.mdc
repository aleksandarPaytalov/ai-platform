# Step 10 Task 1: Create Supabase Edge Functions

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Step 10: Automated Update System** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This is **Task 10.1** focusing exclusively on creating Supabase Edge Functions for automated content processing. 

**IMPORTANT**: This rule references and must comply with:
- `global-behavior.mdc` - AI behavior and communication patterns
- `technology-standards.mdc` - Technology stack standards and patterns  
- `quality-standards.mdc` - Code quality and testing requirements

## Current Step Context
- **Phase**: Phase 4 - AI Integration
- **Step**: 10 - Automated Update System  
- **Task**: 10.1 - Create Supabase Edge Functions
- **Prerequisites**: Anthropic API integration (Step 9) must be completed

## Task Objective
Create Supabase Edge Functions infrastructure for automated daily processing of AI tool feature updates, including content scraping, parsing, error handling, and monitoring capabilities.

## AI Instructions

### 1. Create Edge Function for Automated Daily Update Processing
- Set up new Supabase Edge Function using Deno runtime in `supabase/functions/` directory
- Create main processing function named `daily-update-processor` with proper TypeScript structure
- Implement function entry point following Supabase Edge Functions patterns with proper HTTP request/response handling
- Create modular function architecture separating concerns (scraping, parsing, validation, storage)
- Add proper environment variable handling for Supabase and external API credentials
- Implement proper CORS handling and security headers for function execution
- Create function configuration files (`supabase/functions/daily-update-processor/index.ts`)

### 2. Implement Content Scraping from Official AI Tool Sources
- Create scraping utilities for different AI tool official sources (blogs, release notes, documentation pages)
- Implement HTTP client configuration with proper user agents, headers, and rate limiting
- Add support for different content formats: HTML pages, RSS feeds, API endpoints, markdown files
- Create source configuration management with URLs and scraping patterns for all 15 AI tools
- Implement content change detection using checksums/hashes to avoid processing unchanged content
- Add request retry logic with exponential backoff for failed scraping attempts
- Create concurrent scraping with proper throttling to respect source server limits

### 3. Add HTML Parsing and Content Extraction Logic
- Implement HTML parsing using Deno-compatible libraries for content extraction
- Create content selectors and parsing rules for different website structures and formats
- Add text extraction, cleaning, and normalization for consistent data processing
- Implement metadata extraction (publication dates, author information, categories)
- Create image URL extraction and validation for screenshots and media content
- Add structured data extraction (JSON-LD, Open Graph, meta tags) for richer information
- Implement fallback parsing strategies when primary selectors fail

### 4. Create Proper Error Handling and Logging
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all scraping and parsing operations
- Add structured logging with different levels (info, warn, error, debug) using Supabase Edge Function logging
- Create error categorization (network errors, parsing errors, validation errors, rate limiting)
- Implement error recovery strategies with graceful degradation for partial failures
- Add detailed error context and stack traces for debugging purposes
- Create error notification system for critical failures requiring manual intervention
- Implement error rate monitoring and automatic function disabling for excessive failures

### 5. Implement Function Deployment Configuration and Environment Management
- Create deployment configuration files (`supabase/config.toml` updates for Edge Functions)
- Set up environment variable management for different deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Configure function secrets and API keys using Supabase secrets management
- Add function resource limits (memory, timeout, concurrent executions) appropriate for content processing
- Create deployment scripts and automation for consistent function updates
- Implement version management and rollback capabilities for function deployments
- Add function dependency management and build optimization

### 6. Add Function Monitoring and Performance Tracking
- Implement function execution monitoring with metrics collection (execution time, success rate, errors)
- Create performance logging for different processing stages (scraping, parsing, storage)
- Add custom metrics for business logic (tools processed, updates found, validation success rate)
- Implement health check endpoints for function availability monitoring
- Create dashboard-compatible metrics export for Supabase monitoring
- Add alerting configuration for function failures and performance degradation
- Implement cost tracking and usage optimization monitoring

### 7. Create Function Testing and Local Development Setup
- Set up local Supabase development environment with Edge Functions support
- Create comprehensive test suite for function logic using Deno testing framework
- Implement unit tests for individual scraping and parsing functions
- Add integration tests for end-to-end function execution with mock data
- Create test data fixtures and mock responses for different AI tool sources
- Implement local testing commands and scripts for development workflow
- Add continuous integration setup for automated function testing

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete Supabase Edge Function infrastructure in `supabase/functions/daily-update-processor/`
- Functional content scraping system supporting all 15 AI tools
- Robust error handling and logging system with structured output
- Local development and testing environment setup
- Deployment configuration ready for production use
- Monitoring and metrics collection system
- Comprehensive test coverage for all function components

## Technical Requirements
- **Runtime**: Deno with TypeScript for Supabase Edge Functions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured error responses
- **Performance**: Function execution under 60 seconds with proper resource management
- **Security**: Proper secrets management and input validation
- **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and metrics for all operations
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with >80% coverage for critical paths
