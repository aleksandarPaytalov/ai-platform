# Step 10 Task 3: Set Up Scheduled Task Execution

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Step 10: Automated Update System** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This is **Task 10.3** focusing exclusively on setting up the scheduled task execution system for automated daily updates.

**IMPORTANT**: This rule references and must comply with:
- `global-behavior.mdc` - AI behavior and communication patterns
- `technology-standards.mdc` - Technology stack standards and patterns  
- `quality-standards.mdc` - Code quality and testing requirements

## Current Step Context
- **Phase**: Phase 4 - AI Integration
- **Step**: 10 - Automated Update System  
- **Task**: 10.3 - Set Up Scheduled Task Execution
- **Prerequisites**: Content Scraping System (Task 10.2) and Supabase Edge Functions (Task 10.1) must be completed

## Task Objective
Create a robust scheduled task execution system that can reliably trigger daily automated updates, manage job queues, handle failures gracefully, and provide comprehensive monitoring and analytics for the update process.

## AI Instructions

### 1. Configure Cron Jobs for Daily Automated Update Execution
- Set up Supabase Edge Functions cron trigger configuration for daily execution
- Create cron job configuration using Supabase's built-in cron scheduling capabilities
- Implement flexible cron expressions allowing different schedules for different AI tools based on their update patterns
- Add timezone handling to ensure updates run at optimal times globally (consider AI tool company locations)
- Create backup scheduling mechanisms using external cron services (GitHub Actions, Vercel Cron) as fallbacks
- Implement cron job health monitoring to detect missed or failed scheduled executions
- Add cron job configuration management allowing schedule changes without redeployment

### 2. Create Scheduling System with Flexible Timing and Timezone Handling
- Design scheduling configuration schema supporting multiple schedule types (daily, weekly, custom intervals)
- Implement timezone-aware scheduling using proper timezone libraries (date-fns-tz or similar)
- Create intelligent scheduling that distributes tool checks across time periods to avoid peak loads
- Add schedule optimization based on historical update patterns for each AI tool
- Implement dynamic schedule adjustment based on content change frequency analysis
- Create holiday and weekend scheduling considerations for business-focused AI tools
- Add manual schedule override capabilities for immediate or delayed execution

### 3. Implement Job Queue Management for Processing Multiple Tools Concurrently
- Create job queue system using Supabase database tables for job storage and state management
- Implement concurrent job processing with configurable concurrency limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Add job prioritization system based on tool importance, last update time, and user interest
- Create job batching capabilities to group related tasks for efficient processing
- Implement job dependency management ensuring prerequisite tasks complete before dependent tasks
- Add job queue monitoring with real-time status updates and queue depth tracking
- Create job cleanup mechanisms to remove completed jobs and prevent queue bloat

### 4. Add Job Monitoring, Logging, and Failure Notifications
- Implement comprehensive job execution logging with structured data (job ID, tool, start time, duration, status)
- Create job status tracking system with states (queued, running, completed, failed, retrying)
- Add real-time job monitoring dashboard accessible via API endpoints for status checking
- Implement failure notification system using email, Slack, or Discord webhooks for critical failures
- Create job performance analytics tracking execution times, success rates, and resource usage
- Add job execution history with searchable logs and filtering capabilities
- Implement alerting system for unusual job patterns (long execution times, high failure rates)

### 5. Create Manual Trigger Capabilities for Testing and Immediate Updates
- Implement manual job trigger endpoints accessible via API calls for immediate execution
- Create admin interface or CLI commands for triggering specific tool updates manually
- Add bulk trigger capabilities for updating multiple tools simultaneously
- Implement job preview functionality showing what would be processed without actual execution
- Create test mode execution that runs full pipeline with mock data for testing purposes
- Add job cancellation capabilities for stopping long-running or problematic jobs
- Implement job debugging mode with enhanced logging and step-by-step execution tracking

### 6. Implement Job History and Execution Analytics
- Create comprehensive job history database schema tracking all execution attempts and outcomes
- Implement job execution analytics with metrics (average execution time, success rate, error patterns)
- Add trend analysis for job performance over time with visualization-ready data
- Create job comparison analytics showing performance differences between tools and time periods
- Implement cost tracking for job execution resources and API usage
- Add job efficiency metrics identifying optimization opportunities
- Create historical data retention policies with archiving for long-term storage

### 7. Add Job Retry Mechanisms and Failure Recovery
- Implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for failed jobs
- Create retry configuration per job type with different strategies for different failure types
- Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures when external services are down
- Implement partial failure recovery allowing jobs to resume from last successful checkpoint
- Create failure categorization system distinguishing between retryable and permanent failures
- Add dead letter queue for jobs that exceed maximum retry attempts
- Implement automatic failure recovery procedures with escalation to manual intervention when needed

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete scheduled task execution system integrated with Supabase Edge Functions
- Flexible cron job configuration with timezone handling and schedule optimization
- Job queue management system with concurrent processing and prioritization
- Comprehensive job monitoring and logging with failure notifications
- Manual trigger capabilities with admin interface for immediate updates
