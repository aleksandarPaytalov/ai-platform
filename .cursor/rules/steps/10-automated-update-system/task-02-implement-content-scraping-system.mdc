# Step 10 Task 2: Implement Content Scraping System

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Step 10: Automated Update System** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This is **Task 10.2** focusing exclusively on implementing the content scraping system for AI tool websites and platforms.

**IMPORTANT**: This rule references and must comply with:
- `global-behavior.mdc` - AI behavior and communication patterns
- `technology-standards.mdc` - Technology stack standards and patterns  
- `quality-standards.mdc` - Code quality and testing requirements

## Current Step Context
- **Phase**: Phase 4 - AI Integration
- **Step**: 10 - Automated Update System  
- **Task**: 10.2 - Implement Content Scraping System
- **Prerequisites**: Supabase Edge Functions (Task 10.1) must be completed

## Task Objective
Create a comprehensive web scraping system that can reliably extract content from different AI tool websites and platforms, with robust error handling, respectful scraping practices, and security measures.

## AI Instructions

### 1. Create Web Scraping Utilities for Different AI Tool Websites and Platforms
- Create modular scraping utilities in `lib/scraping/` directory with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement base scraper class with common functionality (HTTP requests, headers, retries)
- Create specialized scrapers for each AI tool platform type (WordPress blogs, GitHub releases, documentation sites, RSS feeds)
- Add scraper factory pattern to dynamically create appropriate scraper based on source type
- Implement URL validation and normalization for consistent scraping targets
- Create scraping session management with proper connection pooling and resource cleanup
- Add support for JavaScript-rendered content using headless browser capabilities where needed

### 2. Implement Content Parsing for Various Formats
- Create parsers for RSS feeds using XML parsing libraries compatible with Deno runtime
- Implement HTML content parsing with DOM traversal for blog posts and announcement pages
- Add JSON API endpoint parsing for tools that provide structured data endpoints
- Create markdown file parsing for documentation and changelog formats
- Implement PDF parsing capabilities for tools that publish updates in PDF format
- Add support for social media content parsing (Twitter API, LinkedIn posts) where available
- Create content format detection and automatic parser selection based on content type

### 3. Add Content Change Detection to Avoid Duplicate Processing
- Implement content hashing system using SHA-256 for detecting changes in scraped content
- Create content fingerprinting that focuses on meaningful changes (not timestamps or ads)
- Add database storage for content hashes with associated metadata (URL, last checked, hash value)
- Implement incremental scraping that only processes changed content since last check
- Create content diff analysis to identify specific sections that changed
- Add smart caching with TTL (Time To Live) based on content update frequency patterns
- Implement content versioning system for tracking historical changes

### 4. Create Robust Error Handling for Scraping Failures and Rate Limiting
- Implement comprehensive error categorization (network timeouts, HTTP errors, parsing failures, rate limits)
- Add exponential backoff retry logic with jitter for failed requests
- Create circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable problematic sources
- Implement rate limit detection and automatic backoff based on HTTP headers (429 responses, Retry-After)
- Add fallback mechanisms when primary scraping methods fail
- Create detailed error logging with context (URL, error type, retry attempts, timestamp)
- Implement dead letter queue for repeatedly failing scrape attempts requiring manual review

### 5. Implement Respectful Scraping Practices with Proper Delays and User Agents
- Add configurable delays between requests with randomization to avoid detection
- Implement robots.txt parsing and compliance for each target website
- Create realistic user agent rotation with browser headers that match common patterns
- Add IP rotation support for high-volume scraping (if using proxy services)
- Implement request frequency limits based on website capacity and terms of service
- Create scraping schedule optimization to distribute load across time periods
- Add monitoring for scraping impact and automatic throttling if server response times increase

### 6. Add Content Sanitization and Security Measures
- Implement HTML sanitization to remove malicious scripts and unsafe content
- Add input validation for all scraped URLs and content before processing
- Create content filtering to remove ads, navigation, and irrelevant page elements
- Implement XSS protection for content that will be displayed in the application
- Add content length limits and validation to prevent oversized content processing
- Create malware scanning integration for downloadable content and attachments
- Implement data privacy compliance measures (GDPR, CCPA) for any personal information in scraped content

### 7. Create Scraping Configuration Management for Different Sources
- Design configuration schema for each AI tool source (URLs, selectors, update frequency, parsing rules)
- Create JSON/YAML configuration files for easy maintenance and updates without code changes
- Implement configuration validation and schema enforcement to prevent invalid settings
- Add dynamic configuration reloading without restarting the scraping system
- Create configuration versioning and rollback capabilities for problematic changes
- Implement A/B testing for different scraping configurations to optimize success rates
- Add configuration management UI or admin interface for non-technical configuration updates

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete content scraping system in `lib/scraping/` directory with modular architecture
- Specialized scrapers for all 15 AI tools with their specific content formats
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms with comprehensive logging
- Content change detection system with hash-based comparison
- Respectful scraping implementation following robots.txt and rate limiting
- Content sanitization and security measures protecting against malicious content
- Configuration management system for easy maintenance and updates
- Comprehensive test coverage for all scraping scenarios

## Technical Requirements
- **Runtime**: Deno-compatible libraries for Edge Functions environment
- **Performance**: Concurrent scraping with proper throttling and resource management
- **Security**: Input validation, content sanitization, and XSS protection
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful degradation
- **Compliance**: robots.txt adherence and respectful scraping practices
- **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and metrics for scraping performance and errors
