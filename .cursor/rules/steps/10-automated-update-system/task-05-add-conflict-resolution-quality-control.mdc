- `quality-standards.mdc` - Code quality and testing requirements

## Current Step Context
- **Phase**: Phase 4 - AI Integration
- **Step**: 10 - Automated Update System  
- **Task**: 10.5 - Add Conflict Resolution and Quality Control
- **Prerequisites**: Update Processing Pipeline (Task 10.4), Scheduled Task Execution (Task 10.3), Content Scraping System (Task 10.2), and Supabase Edge Functions (Task 10.1) must be completed

## Task Objective

- Implement content comparison algorithms detecting conflicts in key fields (release dates, feature descriptions, availability, impact levels)
- Add semantic analysis using AI to detect conceptual conflicts even when using different terminology
- Create conflict severity assessment categorizing conflicts as minor (formatting differences) vs major (contradictory facts)
- Implement multi-source correlation system tracking how often sources agree or disagree historically
- Add temporal conflict resolution considering publication timestamps and source update frequencies
- Create conflict visualization system showing side-by-side comparisons of conflicting information for human review

### 2. Create Priority System and Source Reliability Scoring

- Implement source priority hierarchy giving preference to official sources (company blogs, documentation) over third-party sources
- Add dynamic reliability scoring that adjusts based on recent accuracy performance and correction frequency
- Create source categorization system (Official, Semi-Official, Community, News, Aggregator) with different trust levels
- Implement content freshness weighting giving preference to more recent information when sources conflict
- Add source expertise scoring based on technical depth and accuracy of historical content
- Create reliability decay system reducing trust scores over time for sources that become less accurate

### 3. Add Human Review Queue for Ambiguous or Conflicting Updates

- Implement review workflow with status tracking (pending, in-review, resolved, escalated)
- Add review templates and guided workflows helping reviewers make consistent decisions
- Create review analytics tracking resolution times, decision patterns, and reviewer performance

### 4. Implement Automated Conflict Resolution Rules and Decision Trees
- Create rule-based conflict resolution system handling common conflict scenarios automatically
- Implement decision trees for different conflict types (date conflicts, feature availability, impact assessment)
- Add confidence-based automatic resolution accepting high-confidence information while queuing uncertain cases
- Create majority consensus resolution using multiple sources to determine most likely accurate information
- Implement pattern-based resolution learning from historical human decisions to automate similar future conflicts
- Add contextual resolution rules considering AI tool company communication patterns and release cycles
- Create escalation rules automatically promoting complex conflicts to human review based on defined criteria

### 5. Create Audit Trails for All Automated Decisions and Changes
- Implement comprehensive audit logging system recording every automated decision with full context
- Create decision justification system documenting why specific resolution choices were made

- Implement correction workflow enabling fixes to published content when errors are discovered
- Add override justification system requiring documentation for all manual interventions
- Create correction propagation system updating all affected content when corrections are made
- Implement override tracking and analytics monitoring frequency and reasons for manual interventions
- Add correction notification system alerting stakeholders when significant corrections are made
- Create learning integration system using manual overrides to improve future automated decision-making

### 7. Include Quality Metrics and Continuous Improvement Tracking
