# Task 4.3: Create Loading & Error Components

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Task 4.3** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This task focuses ONLY on creating reusable loading skeleton components and comprehensive error handling components. Do NOT implement any business logic, data fetching, or actual content components beyond what is explicitly listed in the AI Instructions below.

## Technology Standards for This Task
- **React components** with TypeScript and proper interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with consistent design system
- **Accessibility** with proper ARIA attributes and screen reader support
- **Animation** using Tailwind CSS animations and transitions
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages and recovery options
- **Responsive design** that works across all device sizes

## AI Instructions

Complete the following tasks in exact order:

### 1. Create Base Loading Skeleton Components (`src/components/ui/loading/`)

- Include error reporting functionality (console logging for now)

### 6. Create Empty State Components (`src/components/ui/empty/`)
