# Task 4.1: Create Application Layout System

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Task 4.1** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This task focuses ONLY on creating the foundational application layout system with responsive header, footer, and global HTML structure. Do NOT implement any other features, components, or functionality beyond what is explicitly listed in the AI Instructions below.

## Technology Standards for This Task
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router and server components
- **TypeScript** with strict mode and proper type definitions
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with mobile-first responsive design
- **Semantic HTML5** with proper accessibility attributes
- **SEO optimization** with meta tags and Open Graph configuration

## AI Instructions

Complete the following tasks in exact order:

### 1. Create Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Create `app/layout.tsx` with proper HTML5 document structure
- Include proper `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags with TypeScript interfaces
- Add essential meta tags: viewport, charset, description
- Configure Next.js metadata API with title template and default metadata
- Include Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing
- Add favicon and app icon configuration
- Import and apply global CSS and Tailwind CSS
- Set up proper font configuration (system fonts or Google Fonts)
- Add proper TypeScript interface for layout props with children

### 2. Create Header Component (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)
- Design responsive header component with semantic `<header>` element
- Include application logo/brand (placeholder text "AI Feature Tracker" for now)
- Add navigation placeholder structure (empty `<nav>` element for future implementation)
- Include search bar placeholder (empty `<div>` with search styling for future implementation)
- Implement responsive behavior: mobile hamburger menu placeholder, desktop horizontal layout
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent spacing and colors
- Add proper ARIA labels and accessibility attributes
- Include TypeScript interface for Header props (if any)
- Make header sticky/fixed at top with proper z-index
- Add proper semantic HTML structure with heading hierarchy

### 3. Create Footer Component (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`)
- Design footer component with semantic `<footer>` element
- Include copyright information and current year (dynamic)
- Add placeholder links section (About, Privacy, Terms, Contact)
- Include "Last updated" information display (placeholder for now)
- Add social media links placeholders (GitHub, Twitter, etc.)
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and responsive layout
- Include proper semantic HTML with navigation and content sections
- Add TypeScript interface for Footer props (if any)
- Ensure footer sticks to bottom on short content pages
- Include proper accessibility attributes and ARIA labels

### 4. Integrate Layout Components
- Import Header and Footer components into `app/layout.tsx`
- Create proper layout structure: Header → Main Content → Footer
- Add proper semantic HTML5 structure with `<main>` element for content area
- Configure proper spacing and layout flow between components
- Ensure main content area expands to fill available space
- Add proper CSS classes for layout structure and responsiveness
- Test layout responsiveness at different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify semantic HTML structure and accessibility

### 5. Configure Global Styling and Responsive Design
- Set up Tailwind CSS configuration if not already done
- Create global CSS file (`src/app/globals.css`) with base styles
- Configure responsive breakpoints and mobile-first approach
- Add smooth scrolling behavior and focus management styles
- Set up consistent color scheme and typography scale
- Configure proper spacing and layout utilities
- Add print styles (basic) for better printing experience
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance

### 6. Add SEO and Performance Optimization
- Configure Next.js metadata API with proper title templates
- Add structured data markup (JSON-LD) for website/organization
- Set up proper canonical URLs and meta descriptions
- Configure robots.txt directives in metadata
- Add proper lang attribute and locale configuration
- Optimize font loading and prevent layout shift
- Add proper meta tags for mobile optimization
- Configure proper viewport and scaling settings

### 7. Implement Accessibility Features
- Add skip-to-content link for keyboard navigation
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Add proper ARIA landmarks (banner, main, contentinfo)
- Include focus management and visible focus indicators
- Add proper alt text placeholders for future images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Test with screen reader accessibility (basic semantic structure)
- Add proper contrast and color accessibility
