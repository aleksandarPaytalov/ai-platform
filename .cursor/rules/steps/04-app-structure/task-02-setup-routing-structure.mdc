# Task 4.2: Set Up Routing Structure

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Task 4.2** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This task focuses ONLY on creating the routing structure using Next.js 14 App Router with proper loading states, error boundaries, and route configuration. Do NOT implement any actual content, UI components, or business logic beyond what is explicitly listed in the AI Instructions below.

## Technology Standards for This Task
- **Next.js 14+** App Router with server components
- **TypeScript** with strict mode and proper type definitions
- **Dynamic routing** with proper slug validation
- **Error boundaries** with user-friendly error handling
- **Loading states** with skeleton components
- **SEO optimization** with route-specific metadata

## AI Instructions

- Implement basic page structure with semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`)
- Add placeholder content: "AI Feature Tracker Dashboard" heading
- Include temporary content indicating this is the main dashboard
- Set up proper TypeScript page component interface
- Add basic SEO metadata for the homepage
- Include structured data markup for the main page
- Add proper heading hierarchy starting with h1
- Create placeholder sections for future tool grid implementation
- Ensure page is server component by default

### 2. Set Up Dynamic Tool Routes (`app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Create dynamic route structure: `app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Implement proper TypeScript interface for page props with params
- Add slug parameter validation and type checking

- Include retry functionality for recoverable errors
- Add error reporting/logging structure (console.error for now)
- Create different error types: 404, 500, network errors
- Include proper semantic HTML and accessibility
- Add error boundary styling with Tailwind CSS

### 5. Create Not Found Pages (`not-found.tsx` files)

- Include breadcrumb navigation to help users navigate back
- Add semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Style 404 pages consistently with main design system
- Include accessibility features and keyboard navigation

### 6. Configure Route Metadata and SEO
- Set up dynamic metadata generation for all routes

- Configure Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata
- Add proper canonical URL generation
- Set up robots meta tags for different route types
- Create structured data markup for tools and dashboard
- Configure proper title templates and descriptions
- Add language and locale metadata
- Set up proper viewport and mobile optimization meta tags
- Include JSON-LD structured data where appropriate

### 7. Create Navigation Utilities and Route Validation
- Create route validation utilities in `src/lib/routes.ts`
- Add slug validation functions for tool routes
- Create route generation utilities for consistent URL building
- Add route constants and path definitions
- Create navigation helper functions
- Add proper TypeScript types for all route utilities
- Include route parameter validation and sanitization
- Create redirect utilities for invalid routes
- Add route analytics tracking utilities (placeholder)
- Include proper error handling in all route utilities
