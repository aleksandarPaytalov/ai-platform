# Task 4.2: Set Up Routing Structure

## Context and Scope
You are working on **Task 4.2** of the AI Feature Tracker project. This task focuses ONLY on creating the routing structure using Next.js 14 App Router with proper loading states, error boundaries, and route configuration. Do NOT implement any actual content, UI components, or business logic beyond what is explicitly listed in the AI Instructions below.

## Technology Standards for This Task
- **Next.js 14+** App Router with server components
- **TypeScript** with strict mode and proper type definitions
- **Dynamic routing** with proper slug validation
- **Error boundaries** with user-friendly error handling
- **Loading states** with skeleton components
- **SEO optimization** with route-specific metadata

## AI Instructions

Complete the following tasks in exact order:

### 1. Create Main Dashboard Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Create `app/page.tsx` as the main dashboard route
- Implement basic page structure with semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`)
- Add placeholder content: "AI Feature Tracker Dashboard" heading
- Include temporary content indicating this is the main dashboard
- Set up proper TypeScript page component interface
- Add basic SEO metadata for the homepage
- Include structured data markup for the main page
- Add proper heading hierarchy starting with h1
- Create placeholder sections for future tool grid implementation
- Ensure page is server component by default

### 2. Set Up Dynamic Tool Routes (`app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Create dynamic route structure: `app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Implement proper TypeScript interface for page props with params
- Add slug parameter validation and type checking
- Create placeholder content showing the tool slug parameter
- Add basic tool page structure with semantic HTML
- Include breadcrumb navigation placeholder
- Set up dynamic metadata generation based on slug
- Add proper error handling for invalid slugs

- Ensure proper SEO structure for individual tool pages

### 3. Create Loading States (`loading.tsx` files)
- Create `app/loading.tsx` for main dashboard loading

- Create `app/tools/[slug]/loading.tsx` for individual tool loading
- Design skeleton loading components that match future content layout
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent skeleton styling
- Include proper accessibility attributes (aria-label, role)
- Create different skeleton patterns for different content types
- Add loading animations and transitions
- Ensure skeletons are responsive across all breakpoints
- Include proper semantic structure in loading states

### 4. Implement Error Boundaries (`error.tsx` files)
- Create `app/error.tsx` for global error handling
- Create `app/tools/error.tsx` for tools section errors
- Create `app/tools/[slug]/error.tsx` for individual tool errors
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for error components
- Add user-friendly error messages with clear actions
- Include retry functionality for recoverable errors
- Add error reporting/logging structure (console.error for now)
- Create different error types: 404, 500, network errors
- Include proper semantic HTML and accessibility
- Add error boundary styling with Tailwind CSS

### 5. Create Not Found Pages (`not-found.tsx` files)
- Create `app/not-found.tsx` for global 404 handling
- Create `app/tools/not-found.tsx` for invalid tool routes
- Design user-friendly 404 pages with helpful navigation
- Include search suggestions or popular tools list (placeholder)
- Add proper SEO metadata for 404 pages
- Include breadcrumb navigation to help users navigate back
- Add semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Style 404 pages consistently with main design system
- Include accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- Add analytics tracking for 404 pages (placeholder)

### 6. Configure Route Metadata and SEO
- Set up dynamic metadata generation for all routes
- Create metadata templates for different page types
- Configure Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata
- Add proper canonical URL generation
- Set up robots meta tags for different route types
- Create structured data markup for tools and dashboard
- Configure proper title templates and descriptions
- Add language and locale metadata
- Set up proper viewport and mobile optimization meta tags
- Include JSON-LD structured data where appropriate

### 7. Create Navigation Utilities and Route Validation
- Create route validation utilities in `src/lib/routes.ts`
- Add slug validation functions for tool routes
- Create route generation utilities for consistent URL building
- Add route constants and path definitions
- Create navigation helper functions
- Add proper TypeScript types for all route utilities
- Include route parameter validation and sanitization
- Create redirect utilities for invalid routes
- Add route analytics tracking utilities (placeholder)
- Include proper error handling in all route utilities
