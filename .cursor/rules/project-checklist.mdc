# AI Feature Tracker - Master Project Checklist

## Rule Metadata
- **Type**: Always Applied
- **Scope**: Master Project Progress Tracking
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive progress tracking system for entire AI Feature Tracker development
- **Usage**: Track completion status of all phases, steps, and tasks throughout development lifecycle

## Project Overview
The AI Feature Tracker is a real-time web application for tracking AI capabilities across 15+ major AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). This master checklist provides complete visibility into project progress across 6 phases, 15 steps, and 75+ individual tasks.

## Progress Tracking Instructions

### Checkbox System
- **Incomplete**: `[ ]` - Task/step/phase not yet completed
- **Complete**: `[X]` - Task/step/phase fully completed and verified
- **Progress Marking**: Change `[ ]` to `[X]` when items are completed
- **Completion Requirements**: Mark as complete only when all acceptance criteria are met

### Completion Dependencies
- **Task Completion**: Individual tasks marked complete when all requirements met
- **Step Completion**: Steps marked complete only when ALL tasks within step are complete
- **Phase Completion**: Phases marked complete only when ALL steps within phase are complete
- **Quality Gates**: Each phase includes quality gate that must pass before proceeding

### AI Command Examples
- **Individual Task**: "Mark Task 1.3 as completed" → Change `- [ ] Task 1.3: Create Technology Standards Rule` to `- [X] Task 1.3: Create Technology Standards Rule`
- **Full Step**: "Mark Step 2 and all its tasks as completed" → Mark step header and all 5 tasks as `[X]`
- **Multiple Tasks**: "Mark Tasks 01, 02, and 03 of Step 4 as completed" → Mark specific tasks within step
- **Phase**: "Mark Phase 1 as completed" → Mark phase and all steps/tasks within it as `[X]`
